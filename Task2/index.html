                    <p class="content-blog">
                        When I first decided to learn front-end development, I was a little confused and questioned
                        myself ‚Äî

                        ‚ÄúIs this really the right path for me?‚Äù
                        But as time went on, I found myself getting more and more invested in it.
                        It not only connected me with logical reasoning but also unlocked my creative side.

                        I began my journey with CodeWithHarry‚Äôs tutorials and made my own notes, which helped me a
                        lot
                        for
                        future reference.
                        I completed every project I could, and alongside that, I also explored <strong>The Odin
                            Project</strong>, which helped me strengthen my foundation in web development even
                        further.

                    <button class="but-blog">Read more</button>
                    <p class="content-blog">
                        When I came across the Oasis Infobyte internship opportunity, I was both excited and
                        nervous.
                        It was my very first internship, and I was worried about whether I could manage my time well
                        enough
                        to
                        complete the projects on time.

                        When I received the offer letter, my happiness doubled ‚Äî but so did my nervousness.
                        Fortunately, the internship was self-paced, which made it easier to manage and allowed me to
                        focus
                        on learning at my own speed.

                        During the internship, I sharpened my front-end skills and gained more confidence working
                        with
                        JavaScript ‚Äî a language I had always felt insecure about before.
                        Completing real projects gave me the assurance that I could write clean, functional code.

                        I‚Äôm truly thankful to Oasis Infobyte for giving me this opportunity to grow and become more
                        confident in my abilities.

                    <p class="content-blog">
                        Writing has always been something that calms my mind and clears away negative thoughts.
                        When I put my problems down on paper, I gain more clarity ‚Äî not just about the problem
                        itself,
                        but
                        also about how to approach it.

                        This habit has improved my logical thinking and sharpened my problem-solving skills.
                        It‚Äôs not only helped me resolve personal doubts but has also made it easier to work through
                        technical challenges as a developer.
                        For me, writing is more than just an outlet ‚Äî it‚Äôs a tool for better thinking.

                    <p class="content-blog">One thing I truly enjoy as a developer is exploring new technologies.
                        Whether it‚Äôs a new JavaScript
                        framework, a design tool, or even a small browser extension that makes coding easier, I love
                        diving
                        into it and figuring out how it works. Every new tool feels like unlocking a new superpower,
                        and
                        experimenting with them not only keeps my skills updated but also keeps me excited about the
                        endless
                        possibilities in tech.</p>
